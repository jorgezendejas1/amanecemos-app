⚙️ MAIN FEATURES

1. DAILY ENTRY SCREEN  
- Top bar: “AMANECIMOS CON”  
- Bottom bar: “ANOCHECEMOS CON”  
- A button “+” above the text field to add new records.  
- Fields:  
  • Type of movement (Expense or Income)  
  • Category (dropdown)  
  • Subcategory (auto-filled by AI after approval)  
  • Description  
  • Amount (in MXN)  
  • Date (auto-set to today, editable)  
  • Photo (optional: AI extracts concept and amount)  
  • Comments (optional)  
- When a record is saved, the app updates the remaining budget automatically.  
- AI learns from user confirmations:  
  ✅ approved category → auto-applied next time  
  ❌ rejected → AI offers a new suggestion  

2. BUDGET SCREEN (PRESUPUESTO)  
- Users can set or edit the available budget for each category.  
- Each record stores:  
  • Category name  
  • Total budget  
  • Remaining amount  
  • Date of last modification  
- AI can update or adjust budgets automatically based on spending patterns.  
- The user can override these values manually at any time.  

3. INCOME (DEPÓSITOS) HANDLING  
- Incomes are added from the same “+” button using the same interface.  
- If the user selects “Income”, the amount is added to the corresponding category budget.  
- All income transactions are saved in the database for analysis.

4. DATA MANAGEMENT  
- All records (expenses, incomes, budgets) are stored in Firebase Firestore.  
- Images or receipts are stored in Firebase Storage.  
- AI operations (category suggestion, budget adjustment) use Google Cloud Functions + Vertex AI.

5. ANALYTICS & INSIGHTS  
- Charts for “Top Expenses”, “Remaining Budget by Category”, and “Total Savings”.  
- AI insights suggesting how to optimize spending or redistribute budgets.
